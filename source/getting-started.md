# Getting Started

## Step 1: Installing Zoom

If you have already installed Zoom, please move on to Step 2.

First off, we will need to install the Zoom application if you haven't already. To do so, visit the Zoom website found **[here](https://zoom.us/download)**.

Click on the **Zoom Client for Meetings** download button (see image below for reference) to initiate download of the Zoom Client.

Click on the newly downloaded **ZoomInstaller.exe** file (see image below for reference) found at the bottom-left section of your Chrome tab.

Clicking on this button will automatically install Zoom to your computer. Once the installation is done, you are ready to move onto the next step.

## Step 2: Signing into Zoom

To sign into Zoom, click on either the **Sign in with SSO** button, or the **Sign in with Google** button (see image below for reference). **For those who attend St. Peter's College**, click on the **Sign in with SSO** button.

The next window that will pop up will ask for your company domain (see image below for reference). **For those who attend St. Peter's College**, the field should already be filled in, reading **stpeters**. If it is not, type **stpeters** into the blank space. Click on 'Continue'.

**NOTE:** For the next part to work properly, you **MUST** be signed into Google Chrome with your school account (i.e. _username_@stpeters.vic.edu.au).

When you click on **Continue**, a Google Chrome tab will automatically open. The page (see image below for reference) will ask if you would like to open zoom. Click **Open Zoom**.
