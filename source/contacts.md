# Contacts

Selecting the **Contacts** tab will take you to a page where you can look at your saved contacts. It is also here on the **Contacts** page that you can access the channels, also known as groups, that you are a part of.

## My Contacts

This particular section of the **Contacts** tab gives you easy access to your personal contacts, made up of contacts that you have starred, and contacts that you have added that are not a part of your organization's contact list.

**NOTE:** In the case of **St. Peter's College** staff, the contact list would be **St. Peter's College Staff**.

#### Starred

Similarly to **[starring a message](http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/#starred)**, you can star particular contacts that you may find yourself communicating more frequently with than others. It is in the starred tab that you can star these aforementioned contacts, so you can easily contact them.

The following steps are very similar to that of starring a message:

To do so, simply find your desired contact, click on the ellipsis logo (...) to the right of the camera logo (see image below for reference), and click **Star this Contact**.

You will see in your **Starred** section that your contact has now appeared (see image below for reference). You will also notice that in the panel to the right of the contact list that you can see your contact's name, their profile picture, their **[status](http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/)**, their department and their email address. You are also given the ability to contact them via **[chat](http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/)** or **[meeting](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/)**.

#### External

While you are provided with a pre-configured list of contacts - you are given the ability to add other contacts, more particularly those who are **external to the St. Peter's College** company contact list. The **External** list is where you will find those contacts.

## All Contacts

**NOTE:** This section relates directly to **St. Peter's College** users.

If you are a staff member, you will notice that you have a pre-determined list of contacts; 230 staff members. This has been pre-configured for your benefit. To access this list, simply click on the arrow next to the **Staff** title (refer to image below for reference).

**NOTE:** You can search for contacts from any screen using the search bar found at the top-right section of your Zoom window (see image below for reference).

## Channels

While discussing one-on-one can be handy in some cases, it is often better when more people are involved; this is where channels come in to play.

Channels enable discussion among groups of users (i.e. not two users), providing those involved the ability to share files, chats, and images to the group. Creating a channel also provides those involved the opportunity to start instant group meetings, mitigating the hassle of scheduling a meeting for the host.

To create a channel, click on the **+** icon to the right of the **Channels** button (see image below for reference).

![CreateChannel](C:\my-project\docs\img\Contacts\CreateChannel.png)

Next, click on the **Create a Channel** button (see image below for reference).

![ChannelEllipsis](C:\my-project\docs\img\Contacts\ChannelEllipsis.png)

Upon clicking the **Create a Channel** button, this following window will appear on your screen.

![CreateAChannel](C:\my-project\docs\img\Contacts\CreateAChannel.png)

**Channel Name:** Give your new channel a unique name.

**Invite Members:** Invite specific individuals from your contact list, to join your channel.

**Members in your organization only:** Limit those who can join to only those in your organization, **St. Peter's Staff Department** for example, or from both your organization contact list, as well as your personal contact list.

**Private/Public:** Determine whether or not contacts require an invitation to join your channel, or if anyone from your organization contact list can join without an invitation, respectively.

Once you have filled in the required fields and are happy with your selections, click on the blue **Create Channel** button (see image below for reference) to complete the creation of your new channel.
