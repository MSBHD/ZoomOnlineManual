# Settings

Though the base Zoom experience will suffice for most users, some may require a more particular experience, and it is the **Settings** menu that these users can modify their Zoom experience.

To access the settings, on the **Home** page, move your cursor over the **cog** icon in the top-right section of the screen (see image below for reference). Click the button.

**NOTE:** The following settings will apply directly to that of **St. Peter's College** staff.

## General

![Settings_(General)](C:\my-project\docs\img\Home\Settings\Settings (General).png)

**Start Zoom when I start Windows:** This option is unable to change as College laptops are required to have Zoom start at the launch of a laptop to automatically login.

**Silently start Zoom when I start Windows:** This option is also unable to change. It starts Zoom alongside your laptop without producing a window, ultimately getting in the way of your work.

**When closed, minimize window to the notification area instead of the task bar:**

**Use dual monitors:** You may have your laptop connected to a dock, in which case you will also have an extra display. If you enable this option, and have your laptop screen and monitor on, Zoom will make use of both monitors once you have joined a meeting (i.e. one for screen sharing and one for webcams). 

**Enter full screen automatically when starting or joining a meeting:** Enabling this option will see that your Zoom instance will enter a full screen mode automatically when you join any meeting.

**Automatically copy invitation URL once the meeting starts:** If you enable this setting, you will find that joining a meeting will copy the meeting invitation link to your clipboard. This has been implemented to allow users to easily invite other contacts to the meeting.

**Ask me to confirm when I leave a meeting:** Enabling this option will see Zoom ask you to confirm that you would like to leave a meeting to ensure that you did not click the **[Leave Meeting](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)** button by accident.

**Show me my connected time:** Enabling this option will show you how long you have been connected to a particular meeting. Click **[here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)** to learn more about this.

**Remind me 'x' minutes before my upcoming meetings:** Enabling this option will allow Zoom to send a reminder to you, of any upcoming meetings that you may be a part of.

**Stop my video and audio when my display is off or screen saver begins:** Enabling this option will see that your account has both its video and audio disabled when your device's display turns off, or goes to sleep. This will occur during your participation in meetings.

**Reaction Skin Tone:** Switching this particular option will change the skin tone of your **[meeting reactions](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)**.

## Video

![Settings_(Video)](C:\my-project\docs\img\Home\Settings\Settings (Video).png)

**Camera:** This particular option allows you to choose the camera that your computer will make use of, when sharing your video when in a Zoom meeting.

**16:9 (Widescreen)/Original Ratio:** 

**Enable HD:** Enabling this option will activate HD quality for your webcam when in a Zoom meeting. Disable this feature if you are experiencing connectivity issues in meetings.

**Mirror my video:** Enabling this feature will flip your webcam output.

**Touch up my appearance:** Enabling this feature will implement a 'smooth' filter on your webcam.

**Turn off my video when joining meeting:** Enabling this feature will allow Zoom to automatically disable your webcam feed when you join a meeting.

**Hide non-video participants:** Enabling this feature will allow Zoom to hide the camera feed of all participants in a meeting who are not sharing their webcam feed in the **[Gallery](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)**.

**Spotlight my video when I speak:** Enabling this feature sees that your webcam feed is displayed on your own screen when you speak during a Zoom meeting.

![Settings_(Audio)](C:\my-project\docs\img\Home\Settings\Settings (Audio).png)

**Speaker:** This option allows you to choose which speakers (if you have more than the integrated speakers on your laptop) Zoom will output audio to (be it notifications, or meeting audio).

**Microphone:** This option allows you to choose which microphone (if you have more than the integrated microphone on your laptop) Zoom will use to record your voice for meetings.

**Use separate audio device to play ringtone simultaneously:** Enable this feature if you have a separate headset that you connect to your computer. This feature allows Zoom to play ringtones through a separate audio device (i.e. speakers) so you can hear calls in the event you are away from your computer.

**Automatically join audio by computer when joining a meeting:** Enabling this option will see that Zoom does not ask to join a meeting with microphone audio, and instead will automatically join with audio to said meeting.

**Do not prompt the join audio dialog when I am using 3rd party audio:** 

**Press and hold SPACE key to temporarily unmute yourself:**

**Sync buttons on headset:**

## Share Screen

![Settings_(Share_Screen)](C:\my-project\docs\img\Home\Settings\Settings (Share Screen).png)

**Enter full screen when a participant shares screen:** Enabling this feature will see that Zoom enters full screen mode when a fellow participant starts sharing their screen in a meeting. Disable this feature if you complete other work while on a Zoom meeting.

**Maximize Zoom window when a participant share screen:** Enabling this option will see that Zoom enters a full window state, instead of the aforementioned full screen state. This gives you access to as much space possible to view meeting contents while still granting you the ability to multi-task (i.e. not always have the Zoom window open).

**Scale to fit shared content to Zoom window:** Enabling this feature will see that Zoom automatically configures shared content (i.e. participant screen sharing) to fit your Zoom window. 

**NOTE:** This may cause unpleasant distortion of shared content, so be aware that enabling this feature may have such effects.

**Enable the remote control of all applications:** Enabling this feature allows a support participant (click **[here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)** for more information) in any one meeting to take control of your computer if you request assistance.

**Side-by-side mode:** Enabling this feature allows you to present not only your screen - but also your webcam feed to other participants in a meeting. To learn more about this feature, click **[here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/meetings/#meeting-controls)**

**Silence system notifications when sharing desktop:** Enable this feature to see the Zoom silences all system notifications when you share your screen with a meeting. Enable this option to minimize distractions while in a meeting, for both you and the participants.

**Move messages with new replies to the bottom of the chat:**

**Start at the first unread/Start at the latest:** Switching this option will see that Zoom sends you to either the first unread message in a chat so you do not miss any of the conversation, or the latest unread message.

**Push Notifications:**

**Receive notifications for:** Editing this option will allow you to select keywords that, when mentioned in a chat (meeting, chat or channel), will send a notification to you, informing you that the keyword has been mentioned.

**Notify me about new replies on messages I am following:** Enabling this feature will see that Zoom notifies you when new replies are received on messages that you are following. Learn more about following messages **[here](http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/#following-messages)**.

**Do not disturb from:** This particular option allows you to edit the times in which Zoom will not disturb you with notifications from chats, channels and meetings.

**Play sound when I receive a new message:** Enabling this option will see that Zoom plays a sound whenever you receive a message.

**Mute notifications while I am in a meeting or on a call:** Enabling this option will see that Zoom mutes all notifications while in a meeting or call. Enable this to reduce distractions during a meeting or call.

**Show notification banner on screen until dismissed:** Enabling this option will see that Zoom does not automatically remove notification banners. Enable this feature if you know you will be away from your device so you do not miss anything of potential importance.

**Show message preview (uncheck this option for privacy):**
