## Channels

Channels allow you to converse with groups of people, instead of individuals. You can create private or public groups, in which users are able to send chats, files, images, and start instant meetings with the users in the group.

Refer to the **[Contacts](http://127.0.0.1:8000/contacts/#channels)** section of this manual for more information.

## Starred

You, as the user, are able to star messages that are of importance to you. Starring a message copies said message to the **Starred Messages** tab of the Chat menu (see image below for reference).

## Following messages

Following a message allows you to keep track of the conversation that a particular message was a part of. Follow messages if the conversation is of importance to you. To follow a message, click on the ellipsis icon (...) next to any message. Click on **Follow Message**.

## Recent

The **Recent** tab of the Chat page allows you to view all of the contacts you have had contact with most recently. To view the conversations you have recently had, click on the name of the user you were in recent discussion with.

## Blocking Users

Blocking a contact will see that all communication between yourself and said contact is blocked. To block a user, move your cursor over a user whom you would like to block, and click on the downward arrow that appears (see image below for reference).
