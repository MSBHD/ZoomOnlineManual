# Zoom Online Manual

If you have found this website, it means you are in need of assistance with Zoom. Though this manual has been produced solely with the needs of St. Peter's College community members (students, teachers, parents etc.) in mind - members of other school communities can indeed adopt this manual into their learning progress.

**Please note** that the level to which this manual will help those who are from other schools may vary!
