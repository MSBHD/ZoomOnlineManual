### Start with video

Enabling this feature will, upon starting the instant meeting, activate your webcam, and you will be able to see a live view of yourself in the webcam's view.

**NOTE:** Make sure that your webcam has its cover removed or else you will not be able to see yourself!

### Use My Personal Meeting ID (PMI)

Your Personal Meeting ID, or PMI for short, is automatically assigned to you upon creation of your account. This ID gives you access to your own personal meeting room. This meeting room is permanently assigned to you, and is private to yourself, and those whom you share your PMI with.

An example of a Personal Meeting ID would be: 123-456-7890

## 2. Join

Click this button to join an ongoing meeting. You will be required to enter a meeting ID, and your display name. On the pop-up window, you are also given the ability to mute yourself, and turn off your webcam, should you choose to do so.

**Recurring Meetings:** Selecting this option will allow you to host multiple meetings with the same users, without having to set up individual meetings each time.

**Meeting ID:** Decide whether or not to generate a unique meeting ID for the particular meeting, or use your Personal Meeting ID.

**Password:** Selecting this option will require invited users to enter a password upon arrival. You can set a password by clicking on the box to the right of the checkbox (it should contain a preset password).

**Video:** You can decide whether or not yourself (as the host) can have your webcam enabled, or participants (those who were invited) can have their webcams on during the call.

**Audio:** You can choose to either have telephone audio (user chat), computer audio (the sound coming from your screen share), or both.

**Calendar:** You can choose to sync up the meeting/s to a calendar service that you are synced to (Google, Microsoft (Outlook), or others).

**Advanced Options:** Click on the 'Advanced Options' title to reveal extra preferences for you to decide. **Enabling a waiting room** gives participants the opportunity to join the meeting and enter a self-explanatory waiting room. The host can bring individual participants into the main meeting from the waiting room when ready. 

**Enabling join before host** allows participants to join the main meeting (bypassing the aforementioned waiting room) before you (the host) join the meeting. 

**Muting participants on entry** disables the voice input of participants as they join the meeting, this can be undone, by themself, once they join the meeting.
